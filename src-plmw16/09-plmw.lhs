Refinement Checking (with Error)
--------------------------------

\begin{code}
sumBad :: V.Vector Int -> Int
sumBad v = loop 0
  where
    {-@ loop :: Nat -> Int @-}
    loop i
      | i <= size v = at v i + loop (i + 1)

\end{code}


Refinement Checking (Safe)
-------------------

\begin{code}
sum :: V.Vector Int -> Int
sum v = loop 0
  where
    {-@ loop :: Nat -> Int @-}
    loop i
      | i < size v = at v i + loop (i + 1)

Collections & Higher-Order Functions
------------------------------------

\begin{code}
range :: Int -> Int -> [Int]
range lo hi
  | lo < hi   = lo : range (lo + 1) hi
  | otherwise = []

foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
foldr f b []     = b
foldr f b (x:xs) = f x (foldr f b xs)

sumHO :: Vector Int -> Int
sumHO v = foldr add 0 is
  where
    add = \i n -> n + at v i
    is  = range 0 (size v)
\end{code}

Preconditions on Structures
---------------------------

Oops, only valid on **non-empty** lists!

\begin{code}
{-@ average :: ListNE Int -> Int @-}
average xs = total `div` n
  where
    total  = foldr (+) 0 xs
    n      = length xs

length        :: [a] -> Int
length []     = 0
length (_:xs) = 1 + length xs
\end{code}

Need to describe *non-emptiness* !

Measuring Structures
--------------------

\begin{code}
{-@ measure length @-}
{-@ type ListNE a = {v:[a] | 0 < length v } @-}
\end{code}

Now lets go back and *fix* `average` ...

Measures are Refined Constructors
---------------------------------

\begin{spec}
data [a] where
  []  :: {v:[a] | length v == 0}

  (:) :: a
      -> t:[a]
      -> {v:[a] | length v == 1 + length t}
\end{spec}

`length` is **uninterpreted** in Refinement Logic

$$\forall x, y. x = y \Rightarrow f(x) = f(y)$$


Using Measures
--------------

Recall the `map` function:

\begin{code}
{-@ map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b] @-}
map f []     = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
\end{code}

What's the problem here? (Lets fix it!)

\begin{code}
{-@ hwAverage :: ListNE (a, Int) -> Int @-}
hwAverage nxs = average (map snd nxs)

{- type ListN a N = {v:[a] | length v == N} @-}
{- type ListX a X = ListN a (length X)      @-}
\end{code}
